                <h2 class="h2-details">Legend</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    It is believed that Varanasi is the first Jyotirlinga to manifest itself. According to the legend,
                    it was at this place that Shiva (the Hindu god of destruction) manifested as an infinite column of
                    light (Jyotirlinga) in front of Brahma (the Hindu god of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu god of
                    preservation) when they had an argument about their supremacy.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    In order to discover the origin of the luminous column, Vishnu took the form of a boar (Varaha) and
                    tracked the column beneath the ground, while Brahma, who assumed the shape of a swan, scoured the
                    heavens in an attempt to locate the apex of the column. However, both of them were unsuccessful in
                    identifying the source of the luminous column. Yet, Brahma deceitfully asserted that he had
                    discovered the summit of the column, while Vishnu humbly admitted his inability to find the starting
                    point of the radiant column. Due to Brahma's deceit over the discovery of the origin of the luminous
                    column, Shiva penalised him by cutting his fifth head and placing a curse upon him. This curse
                    entailed that Brahma would no longer receive reverence, whereas Vishnu, being truthful, would be
                    equally venerated alongside Shiva and have dedicated temples for eternity.

                    Hindu scriptures describe Vishweshara as the sacred deity of Varanasi, holding the position of king
                    over all the other deities as well as over all the inhabitants of the city and the extended circuit
                    of the Panchkosi, an area (the sacred boundary of Varanasi) spreading over 50 miles.
