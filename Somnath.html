                The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni Sangam
                (the confluence of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran and Saraswati). Soma, the Moon god, is believed to have
                lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it.

                <h2 class="h2-details">Location</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The Somnath temple is located along the coastline in Prabhas Patan, Veraval, Saurashtra region of
                    Gujarat. It is about 400 kilometres (249 mi) southwest of Ahmedabad, 82 kilometres (51 mi) south of
                    Junagadh – another major archaeological and pilgrimage site in Gujarat. It is about 7 kilometres (4
                    mi) southeast of the Veraval railway junction, about 130 kilometres (81 mi) southeast of the
                    Porbandar airport and about 85 kilometres (53 mi) west of the Diu airport.

                    The Somnath temple is located close to the ancient trading port of Veraval, one of three in Gujarat
                    from where Indian merchants departed to trade goods. The 11th-century Persian historian Al-Biruni
                    states that Somnath has become so famous because "it was the harbor for seafaring people and a
                    station for those who went to and fro between Sufala in the country of Zanj (east Africa) and
                    China". Combined with its repute as an eminent pilgrimage site, its location was well known to the
                    kingdoms within the Indian subcontinent. Literature and epigraphical evidence suggest that
                    the medieval-era Veraval port was also actively trading with the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
                    This brought wealth and fame to the Veraval area, as well as the temple.

                    The site of Prabhas Patan was occupied during the Indus Valley Civilisation, 2000–1200 BCE. It was
                    one of very few sites in the Junagadh district to be so occupied. After abandonment in 1200 BCE, it
                    was reoccupied in 400 BCE and continued into the historical period. Prabhas is also close to the
                    other sites similarly occupied: Junagadh, Dwarka, Padri and Bharuch.
