                    Shri Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary
                    feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Due
                    to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion
                    symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is
                    placed over the Gold Mask of Trideva (Brahma Vishnu Shiva). The crown is said to be from the age of
                    Pandavas and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The crown is displayed every
                    Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiva).

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its
                    appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three
                    sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain.
