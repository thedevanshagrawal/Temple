                According to the Hindu legend, Vindya, the deity of the Vindhya mountain range was worshipping Lord
                Shiva to conciliate himself from the sins committed. Thus, he created a sacred geometrical pattern & a
                lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva was pleased with his worship and appeared in two forms, Omkareshwar
                & Amaleswara.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    As per Hindu legend, Vindhya, the deity controlling the Vindhyachal mountain range was worshipping
                    Shiva to propitiate himself from the sins committed. He created a sacred geometrical diagram and a
                    Lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva was pleased with the worship and believed to have appeared in
                    two forms, namely Omkareshwar and Amaleswara. Since the mud mound appeared in the form of Om, the
                    island came to be known as Omkareswar. There is a shrine for Parvati and Ganapati in the temple.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The second story relates to Mandhata and his son's penance. King Mandhata of Ikshvaku clan (an
                    ancestor of Ram) worshipped Shiva here until the Lord manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga. Some
                    scholars also narrate the story about Mandhata's sons-Ambarish and Muchukunda, who had practiced
                    severe penance and austerities here and pleased Shiva. Because of this, the mountain is named
                    Mandhata
