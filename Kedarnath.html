            <p class="paragraph-details">Lord Shiva, who was being pursued by the Pandavas, took the form of a bull and
                disappeared into the ground at Kedarnath. The temple is believed to be built on the spot where Lord
                Shiva disappeared, and the lingam inside the temple is said to have been formed naturally by the
                elements of earth, air, water, and fire.

                <h2 class="h2-details">The temple</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m
                    (12 ft) in circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the
                    temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around
                    Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar which form the Panch
                    Kedar pilgrimage sites. The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava
                    brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva. Statues
                    of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall. An unusual feature of the temple
                    is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a head is seen carved in another
                    temple nearby constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi Shankara
                    was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of Uttarakhand; he
                    is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samādhi mandir of
                    Adi Sankara.

                    The head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from Karnataka.
                    However, unlike in Badrinath temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform the pujas. The
                    pujas are carried out by Raval's assistants on his instructions. The Raval moves with the deity to
                    Ukhimath during the winter season. There are five main priests for the temple, and they become head
                    priests for one year by rotation. The present (2013) Raval of Kedarnath temple is Shri Vageesha
                    Lingacharya from Davanagere district, Karnataka. Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many symbols of
                    the Pandavas. Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar. The tribals here perform a dance called "Pandav
                    Lila". The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga, is known as "Swargarohini", which is
                    located off Badrinath. When Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, was leaving for the heaven, one
                    of his fingers fell on the earth. At that place, Yudhishtira installed a Shiva Linga, which is the
                    size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Lord Shiva and Bheema fought with maces. Bheema was struck
                    with remorse. He started to massage Shiva's body with ghee. In memory of this event, even today,
                    this triangular Shiva lingam is massaged with ghee. Water and bilva-patra leaves are used for
                    worship.
