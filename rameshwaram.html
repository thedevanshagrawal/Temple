            <p class="paragraph-details">Folklore mentions about God Ram's presence in this land, after his 14-year
                exile.
                Local legend has it that Shri Ram was helped back into Rameswaram and into India by his brother Lakshman
                and
                Hanuman along with his band of thousands of monkeys, after finally emerging victorious against the demon
                –
                Ravana.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">The temple in its current form is believed to have been built during the
                    17th
                    century, while Fergusson believes the small vimana in the west corridor belongs to the 11th or 12th
                    century.
                    The temple is said to have been sanctioned for construction by King Kizhavan Sethupathi or
                    Raghunatha
                    Kilavan. The contribution of the Jaffna kings of Pandya Dynasty to the temple was considerable. King
                    Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan (1380–1410 CE) shipped stone blocks from Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee to
                    renovate
                    the temple's sanctum sanctorum. Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan's successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan
                    (Pararacacekaran
                    V), a trustee at Rameswaram who also oversaw structural development of this temple and the promotion
                    of
                    Saivite beliefs donated part of his revenue to Koneswaram. Especially to be remembered are the
                    immense
                    sums
                    that were spent during the tenure of Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai towards the restoration of the
                    Pagodas
                    which were falling into ruins and the splendid Chockattan Mantapam or the cloistered precincts of
                    the
                    temple
                    at Rameswaram that he finally completed. The rulers of Sri Lanka also contributed to the temple;
                    Parakrama
                    Bahu (1153–1186 CE) was involved in the construction of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Also,
                    Sri
                    Lankan king Nissanka Malla, contributed to the temple's development by making donations and sending
                    workers.

                    The temple is one of the most famous pilgrimage sites and has several historical references about
                    it.
                    The
                    Maratha kings who ruled Thanjavur established chatrams or rest houses throughout Mayiladuthurai and
                    Rameswaram between 1745 and 1837 CE and donated them to the temple.

                <h2 class="h2-details">Architecture</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">The primary deity of the temple is Ramanathaswamy (Shiva) in the form of
                    lingam.
                    There are two lingams inside the sanctum - According to tradition, one built by Rama from sand,
                    residing
                    as
                    the main deity, called the Ramalingam, and the one brought by Hanuman from Kailash, called the
                    Vishvalingam.
                    Rama is said to have instructed that the Vishvalingam be worshipped first since it was brought by
                    Hanuman -
                    the tradition continues even today.

                    Like all ancient temples in South India, there is a high compound wall (madil) on all four sides of
                    the
                    temple premises measuring about 865 feet furlong from east to west and one furlong of 657 feet from
                    north to
                    south with huge towers (Gopurams) to the east and the west and finished gate towers to the north and
                    south.
                    The temple has striking long corridors in its interior, running between huge colonnades on platforms
                    above
                    five feet high.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The second corridor is formed by sandstone pillars, beams, and ceiling. The junction of the third
                    corridor
                    on the west and the paved way leading from the western gopuram to the Setumadhava shrine forms a
                    unique
                    structure in the form of a chess board, popularly known as Chokkattan Madapam, where the Utsava
                    deities
                    are
                    adorned and kept during the Vasanthotsavam (Spring festival) and on the 6th day festival in Adi
                    (July–August) and Masi (February–March) conducted by the Sethupathi of Ramnad.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The outer set of corridors is reputed to be the longest in the world, measuring about 6.9 m in
                    height,
                    400
                    feet each in the east and west and about 640 feet in the north and the south. The inner corridors
                    are
                    about
                    224 feet each in the east and the west and about 352 feet each in the north and the south. Their
                    width
                    varies from 15.5 feet to 17 feet in the east and west about 172 feet on the north and south with
                    width
                    varying 14.5 feet to 17 feet. The total length of these corridors is thus 3850 feet. There are about
                    1212
                    pillars in the outer corridor. Their height is about 30 feet from the floor to the center of the
                    roof.
                    The
                    main tower or rajagopuram is 53 m tall. Most pillars are carved with individual compositions. At the
                    beginning, Ramanathaswamy Temple was a thatched shed. The present structure was the work of many
                    individuals
                    spread over a number of centuries. The pride of place in the establishment of the Temple goes to the
                    Setupatis of Ramanathapuram. In the seventeenth century, Dalavai Setupati built a portion of the
                    main
                    eastern Gopuram. In the late eighteenth century, the world-famous third corridor was constructed by
                    Muthuramalinga Setupati who lived for forty-nine years and ruled between 1763 and 1795. The corridor
                    was
                    called "Chokkatan Mandapam". The Mukhya Pradhani (Chief Minister) was Muthuirullappa Pillai and the
                    Chinna
                    Pradhani (Deputy Chief Minister) was Krishna Iyengar. The Setupati's statue and those of his two
                    Pradhanis
                    (ministers) can be seen at the western entrance to the third corridor.
