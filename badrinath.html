            <p class="paragraph-details">Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the
                padmasana
                posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage Narada, who saw Vishnu's consort,
                Lakshmi,
                massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in
                padmasana.

                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of
                    the
                    presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures (c. 1750–500 BCE).[6] According to some accounts, the
                    shrine was worshipped in some form in the Vedic period. Later, during Ashoka's reign, because of the
                    spread of Buddhism, this shrine might have been converted into a Buddhist shrine. The temple was a
                    Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara revived the shrine and converted it to a Hindu
                    temple. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the
                    brightly
                    painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument. Other accounts relate
                    that
                    it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is
                    believed
                    that Shankara resided in the place for six years from 814 to 820 CE. He resided six months in
                    Badrinath
                    and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of
                    Badrinath
                    in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. A traditional
                    story
                    asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler
                    king
                    Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet
                    its
                    expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and
                    accommodate
                    pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had
                    other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and
                    Dharamarakshak Sigamani
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by
                    the
                    devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century.
                    During
                    the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. When the state of
                    Garhwal
                    was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the
                    chairman of the management committee. The selection of priest is done after consultation between
                    Garhwal
                    and Travancore royal families.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the
                    17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage during the
                    great
                    1803 Garhwal earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur. It was still under renovation
                    as
                    late as the 1870s but these were completed by the time of the First World War. At that time, the
                    town
                    was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff, but the number of
                    pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand. The Kumbh Mela festival held every twelve years
                    raised the number of visitors to 50,000 The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by
                    various villages bequeathed by various rajas.

                    During 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to
                    curb
                    illegal encroachment.
