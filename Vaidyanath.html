                Pleased
                with this, Shiva took Ravan for treatment, where he worked as a physician. Due to this aspect of Shiva,
                the
                temple was named Baidyanath .</p>

                <h2 class="h2-details">Legend</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">According to the legends, Ravana was performing penance in the Himalayan
                    region
                    to appease Shiva. He offered nine of his heads as an offering to Shiva. As he was to sacrifice his
                    tenth
                    head, Shiva appeared before him and expressed satisfaction with the offering, Then, Shiva asked what
                    boon he desired. Ravana asked to take the "Kamna Linga' to the island of Lanka and expressed his
                    desire
                    to take Shiva from Kailash to Lanka.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    Shiva agreed to Ravana's request but with a condition. He said that if the lingam was placed en
                    route, it
                    would become the permanent abode of the deity and could never be moved.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    Celestial gods became worried upon hearing that Shiva had departed from his abode on Mount Kailash.
                    They
                    sought a resolution from Vishnu. Vishnu asked Varuna, the deity associated with water, to enter
                    Ravana's
                    stomach through achamana, a ritual that involves sipping water from the palm of one's hand. As a
                    consequence of performing achaman, Ravana departed for Lanka with the lingam and felt the need to
                    urinate in the vicinity of Deoghar.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The story states that Vishnu took the form of a cowherd named Baiju. While Ravana was off to
                    urinate, he
                    gave a lingam to this cowherd. Due to the presence of Varun Dev, Ravana took a very long time to
                    relieve
                    himself. Baiju got angry, having to wait for Ravana, for a very long time. He then positioned the
                    lingam
                    on the ground and left the place. Upon returning, Ravana attempted to pick up the lingam, but was
                    unsuccessful in his endeavor. Ravana became upset after realizing this was the doing of Lord Vishnu
                    and
                    proceeded to press his thumb onto the lingam before departing which partially damaged the Shiv
                    Lingam.
                    The Shiva lingam was then worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu, and other deities and they constructed the
                    Baidyanath Temple. Since then, Mahadev has taken up residence in Deoghar as the embodiment of the
                    Kamna
                    Linga.
