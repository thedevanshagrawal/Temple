            <p class="paragraph-details">He imprisoned an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, Kamrupeshwar and demanded that
                he pray to him instead of Lord Shiva. When Kamrupeshwar refused to do so, Bhima raised his sword to
                destroy the Shivalinga. That is when Lord Shiva appeared before him and reduced him to ashes.

                    The temple is built in the Nagrara style, which combines traditional and modern designs. The temple
                    hall was constructed during the 18th century by Nāna Phadnavis of Peshwa. The Gopura-shikhara of the
                    temple was built by Nāna Phadnavis. The village of Kharosi was granted to the temple by King
                    Shivaji. The daily religious observance was funded through the financial resources which derived
                    from the people of the area.
