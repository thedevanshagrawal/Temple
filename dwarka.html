            <h2 class="h2-details">Brief</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-details">According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by
                Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place). The original
                structure
                was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th–16th century, in the
                Māru-Gurjara style.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">The town of Dwarka in Gujarat has a history that dates back centuries, and
                    mentioned in the Mahabharata epic as the Dwaraka Kingdom. Situated on the banks of river Gomti, the
                    town
                    is described in legend as the capital of Krishna. Evidence such as a stone block with script, the
                    way
                    the stones were dressed showing that dowels had been used, and an examination of anchors found on
                    the
                    site suggest that the harbour site dates only to historical times, with some of the underwater
                    structure
                    being late Medieval. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an
                    ancient
                    port.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    Hindus believe that the original temple was constructed by Vajranabha, the great grand son of
                    Krishna,
                    over the residential palace of Krishna. It was destroyed by Sultan Mahmud Begada in 1472.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The current temple in Chaulukya style was constructed in 15-16th century.

            <div class="detaiils">
                <h2 class="h2-details">Structure</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">The temple covers area of 27-metre by 21-metre with east–west length of
                    29-metre and north–south width of 23 metres. The temple is constructed of limestone and has
                    intricate
                    carvings.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    It is a five storied edifice built over 72 pillars (sandstone temple with 60 pillars is also
                    mentioned).
                    There are two important entrances to the temple, one is the main entry door which is called the
                    Moksha
                    Dvara (meaning "Door to Salvation") and the exit door which is known as the Svarga Dvara (meaning:
                    "Gate
                    to Heaven"). Outside this doorway are 56 steps that leads to the Gomati River.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    In the central sanctum is deitified the main deity Dwarkadhish, the Trivikrama form of Vishnu (see
                    Chaturvimshatimurti). Dwarkadhish is depicted with four arms. Balarama, elder brother of Krishna, is
                    worshipped in the chamber to the left of the main altar. The chamber to the right houses the images
                    of
                    Pradyumna and Aniruddha, son and grandson of Krishna respectively. In shrines surrounding the
                    central
                    shrine, the deities Radha, Jambavati, Satyabhama, and Lakshmi are placed. Shrines of Madhav Raoji
                    (another name for Krishna) and sage Durvasa is also present in the temple. There are also two
                    separate
                    shrines dedicated to Radha Krishna and Devaki in front of the central shrine.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The temple spire rises to a height of 78 metres (256 ft). A flag, hoisted over the spire, shows the
                    sun
                    and moon, which is believed to indicate that Krishna would be there until the sun and moon exist on
                    Earth. The flag, triangular in shape, is 50 feet (15 m) in length. This flag is changed four times a
                    day
                    with a new one and Hindus pay a huge sum of money to hoist it by purchasing a new flag. The money
                    received on this account is credited to the trust fund of the temple to meet the operation and
                    maintenance expenses of the temple.
