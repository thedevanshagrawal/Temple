            <p class="paragraph-details">One of the oldest Hindu temples to still be in use, its main shrine was built
                by
                Anantavarman of the Chodaganga dynasty in the tenth century. The deities within the shrine, however, are
                believed to be much older and are associated with the great mythical ruler of the Satya-yuga, King
                Indrayumna, nephew of Lord Ram.</p>

            <div class="detaiils">
                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">The temple was rebuilt by the Ganga dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga in
                    the
                    10th century CE, as suggested by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant
                    Narasimhadeva
                    II. Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite, and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the
                    Utkala region (in which the temple is located) in 1112 CE. A 1134–1135 CE inscription records his
                    donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    According to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by Anangabhima-deva II: different
                    chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.[13] This
                    suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the
                    reign
                    of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.[14] The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of
                    the
                    subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Gajapati dynasty.
