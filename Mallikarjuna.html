                Srisailam Sri Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple is one of the 18 Maha Shakti Pitha. The legend of Daksha Yaga
                and Sati's self-immolation resulted in the emergence of Sri Parvati in the place of Sati Devi and making
                Shiva a householder. This mythology is the story behind the origin of Shakti Pithas.

                <h2 class="h2-details">Legend</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    When Shiva and Parvati decided to find suitable brides for their sons. Shiva got Buddhi (intellect),
                    Siddhi (spiritual power), and Riddhi (prosperity) married to Ganesha. Kartikeya on his return was
                    enraged and went away to stay alone on Mount Krauncha in Palani in the name of Kumara brahmachari.
                    On seeing his father coming over to pacify him, he tried to move to another place, but on the
                    request of the Devas, stayed close by. The place where Shiva and Parvati stayed came to be known as
                    Srisailam.

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity in the form of Linga (an iconic form of Shiva) was
                    worshipped with jasmine (locally called in Telugu as Mallika), leading to the name of presiding
                    deity as Mallikarjuna.
