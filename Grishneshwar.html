            <p class="paragraph-details">The circular movements of her hands created friction(Grishna) in her hands, and
                from it emerged Lord Shiva. He appeared as a bright light which turned into a linga. Parvathi named this
                linga 'Grishneshwar' (God of Friction) because it was created from the friction between her hands.

                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The temple structure was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate in 13th and 14th-century. The temple went
                    through several rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-Maratha conflict.
                    It was rebuilt in the current form in the 18th century under the sponsorship of queen Ahilyabai
                    Holkar of Indore, after the fall of the Mughal Empire. It is presently an important and active
                    pilgrimage site of the Hindus and attracts long lines of devotees daily. Anyone can enter the temple
                    premises and its inner chambers, but to enter the sanctum sanctorum core (garbha-gruha) of the
                    temple, the local Hindu tradition demands that men must go bare-chested.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The temple was re-constructed by Maloji Bhosale of Verul, (grandfather of Chhatrapati Shivaji
                    Maharaj) in the 16th century and later again by queen Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century. She is
                    credited with rebuilding some of major Hindu temples such as the Kashi Vishvanath temple in
                    Varanasi, a Vishnu temple in Gaya, and a much larger Shiva Jyotirlinga temple in Somnath Temple.
