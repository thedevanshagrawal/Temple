                Legend goes that it was here that a demon called Daaruka imprisoned a Shiva devotee called Supriya. The
                chants of 'Om Namaha Shivay' by Supriya invoked Lord Shiva who arrived here and vanquished the demon. A
                self-manifested Shivalinga appeared here and is prayed to this date.

                <h2 class="h2-details">History</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    A narrative in the Shiva Purana about the Nageshvara Jyotirlinga tells of a demon named Daruk, who
                    attacked a Shiva devotee named Supriya and imprisoned him along with many others in his city of
                    Darukavana, a city under the sea inhabited by sea snakes and demons. At the urgent exhortations of
                    Supriya, the prisoners started to chant the holy mantra of Shiva. Immediately after that, Shiva
                    appeared and the demon was vanquished, later residing there in the form of a Jyotirlinga. The demon
                    had a wife, a demoness named Daruka, who worshipped Mata Parvati. As a result of her penance and
                    devotion, Mata Parvati enabled her to master the forest, where she performed her devotions and
                    renamed the forest 'Darukavana' in her honour. Wherever Daruka went the forest followed her. To save
                    the demons of Darukavana from the punishment of the gods, Daruk summoned up the power Parvati had
                    given her. She then moved the entire forest into the sea where they continued their campaign against
                    the hermits, kidnapping people and keeping them confined in their new lair under the sea, which was
                    how that great Shiva devotee, Supriya, had wound up there.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The arrival of Supriya caused a revolution. He set up a lingam and made the prisoners recite the
                    mantra Om Namaha Shivay in honour of Shiva while he prayed to the lingam. The demons' response to
                    the chanting was to attempt to kill Supriya, though they were thwarted when Shiva appeared and
                    handed him a divine weapon that saved his life. Daruka and the demons were defeated, and Parvati
                    saved the remaining demons. The lingam that Supriya had set up was called Nagesha, the tenth
                    lingam. Shiva once again assumed the form of a Jyotirlinga with the name Nageshwar, while the
                    Goddess Parvati was known as kankeshwari. Shiva then announced that he would show the correct path
                    to those who would worship him.
