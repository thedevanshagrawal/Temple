            <h2 class="h2-details">Brief</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-details">A local legend says that there once was a king called Chandrasena who ruled
                Ujjain and was a Shiva devotee. The Lord appeared in his Mahakal form and destroyed his enemies. Upon
                the request of his devotees, Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become its chief deity.

                <h2 class="h2-details">The temple</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The idol of Mahakaleshwar is known to be dakshinamukhi, which means that it is facing the south.
                    This is a unique feature, upheld by the tantric shivnetra tradition to be found only in
                    Mahakaleshwar among the 12 Jyotirlingas. The idol of Omkareshwar Mahadev is consecrated in the
                    sanctum above the Mahakal shrine. The images of Ganesh, Parvati and Karttikeya are installed in the
                    west, north, and east of the sanctum sanctorum. To the south is the image of Nandi, the vehicle of
                    Shiva. The idol of Nagchandreshwar on the third storey is open for darshan only on the day of Nag
                    Panchami. The temple has five levels, one of which is underground. The temple itself is located in a
                    spacious courtyard surrounded by massive walls near a lake. The shikhar or the spire is adorned with
                    sculptural finery. Brass lamps light the way to the underground sanctum. It is believed that prasada
                    (holy offering) offered here to the deity can be re-offered unlike all other shrines.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-details">
                    The presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternally in the city of Ujjain. The
                    temple of Mahakaleshwar, its shikhar soaring into the sky, an imposing façade against the skyline,
                    evokes primordial awe and reverence with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and
                    its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an
                    unbreakable link with ancient Hindu traditions. On the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held
                    near the temple, and worship goes on through the night. Devotees are not allowed to bring bags,
                    mobile phones and cameras during the visit. Lockers and Cloak Rooms are there for devotees where
                    they can keep their belongings.
